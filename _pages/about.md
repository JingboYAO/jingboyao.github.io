**<font color="MidnightBlue"> About me </font>**

I'm a PhD candidate from the <a href="https://econ.hkust.edu.hk/homepage" style="color: #003366;">Department of Economics</a>, <a href="https://bm.hkust.edu.hk/" style="color: #003366;">Business School</a>, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I obtained my master's degree in Public Finance from the *Chinese Academy of Fiscal Science, Ministry of Finance of China*, and bachelor's degree in Financial Engineering from *Xiamen University*. I was a visiting scholar at the *University of California San Diego* and a senior associate at the *Bank for International Settlements*.
  





**<font color="MidnightBlue"> Research Interests </font>**

My research interests lie in **International Macro and Finance**, **Monetary Economics**, **International Trade**, and the **Chinese Economy**. My current and future work centers on two broad themes: 
+ **From macro to micro**: Understanding the causal effects and transmission mechanisms of macroeconomic shocks—such as monetary policy surprises—on real economic outcomes and financial markets, with a particular focus on international propagation. In this line, I employ state-of-the-art causal identification strategies and leverage detailed micro-level datasets—such as firm-product-level customs records, high-frequency nighttime light data, land transaction information, bond issuance data, forecast surveys, and intraday financial market variations—to trace the propagation of macro shocks.
+ **From micro to macro**: Studying the macroeconomic implications of market frictions and the design of optimal policy responses.  In this regard, I develop structural DSGE models to examine how financial frictions shape the responses of inflation, output, and trade to macroeconomic disturbances. I also analyze optimal policy design and potential international policy coordination in these contexts.

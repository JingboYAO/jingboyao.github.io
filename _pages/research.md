**1. The Spill-back and Spillover Effects of US Monetary Policy: Evidence from Chinese Export Prices** (*with Yao Amber Li, Lingfei Lu, and Shangjin Wei*) 

<details>
<summary><font color="DarkBlue"> Summary </font></summary> 

<table><tr><td bgcolor=AliceBlue> 
We find that an unanticipated tightening of US monetary policy tends to raise US import prices. This ``spill-back" pattern differs from typical open-economy macro models in which a demand effect or an exchange rate effect dominates. We also document a new ``spillover" effect: import prices of other countries also rise following an unexpected US monetary tightening. To understand the mechanism, we examine Chinese exporters and identify a borrowing cost channel - their liquidity conditions generally deteriorate after a US monetary tightening. Indeed, the output price response is greater for firms facing higher borrowing costs or tighter liquidity conditions.

**2. LSAP Shocks and Stock Prices: The Information Effect Revisited** (*with John Rogers, Wenbin Wu, and Juanyi Jenny Xu*)

<details>
<summary><font color="DarkBlue"> Summary </font></summary>

<table><tr><td bgcolor=AliceBlue> 
The central bank information effect is the subject of lively debate. We present a novel finding regarding the effects of U.S. large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) shocks and offer interpretations based on an information effect that varies both over time and across firms. Specifically, positive LSAP shocks depress U.S. stock returns during periods of quantitative easing (QE) but not in other sub-periods. An LSAP easing policy signals a worsening in the Fed's economic outlook, leading to a decrease in equity investors' confidence. This ``LSAP information effect" is more pronounced for more procyclical firms and is state-dependent, with larger effects during worse economic circumstances. The transmission of this LSAP shock information effect works primarily through the risk premium channel, with more significant effects on firms with higher risk exposure.

**3. The International Spillover of Monetary Policy Shock: New Evidence from Nighttime Light** (*with Kaiji Chen, Qichao Wang, and Juanyi Jenny Xu*)

<details>
<summary><font color="DarkBlue"> Summary </font></summary>

<table><tr><td bgcolor=AliceBlue> 
We revisit the international spillover effects of the US monetary policy shock (MPS) using a new data source, the daily nighttime light (NTL), as a high-frequency proxy for real economic activities. We find that the unexpected US tightening has a negative impact on China's output, and the peak comes about two months after the shock. The overall negative response is consistent with a construction investment channel, with the NTL variation mainly driven by non-built-up areas instead of city centers and suburbs. Consistently, cities with lower urbanization rates, and tighter financial conditions respond more negatively to a contractionary shock. Moreover, we show that trade exposure could partially mitigate the overall adverse impacts of a US tightening.

**1. Monetary Transmission and International Price in an Open Economy**

<details>
<summary><font color="DarkBlue"> Summary </font></summary>

<table><tr><td bgcolor=AliceBlue> 
This paper reveals a new finding that the tightening of the US monetary policy shocks sometimes causes an increase in its import prices, which is contrary to the prediction of classical models and is against the Federal Reserve's efforts to control domestic inflation. Instead, it is consistent with the cost channel of monetary policy. In light of this, I embed this channel into a two-country open-economy New Keynesian model to study the transmission of monetary policy. It is found that this supply-side cost mechanism will increase inflation at home and abroad and aggravate the adverse spillover and spillback effects of monetary tightening on consumption by worsening exports in the foreign country and deteriorating the terms of trade in the home country. Finally, I also explore the optimal domestic policy and international coordination under this context.

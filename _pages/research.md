This paper examines how global monetary policies impact the export pricing behaviors of Chinese firms using unexpected exogenous monetary shocks and disaggregated customs export data. Our findings show that the unexpected tightening of the US monetary policy will lead to an increase in China's export prices. This effect is attributed to a borrowing cost channel, which is related to firms' trade credit and liquidity conditions. Moreover, the impact of US monetary policy shocks on export prices is more profound for firms that face higher borrowing costs, tighter trade credit, and liquidity conditions. To further explain our empirical findings, we develop a heterogeneous firm trade model that incorporates financial frictions and external monetary shocks.

<table><tr><td bgcolor=AliceBlue> 
This paper provides evidence on the Fed information effect of large-scale asset purchases (LSAP) through the responses of US firm-level stock prices. We first present a novel empirical finding that unexpected expansionary US LSAP shocks, derived from high-frequency future price changes around FOMC announcements, have a negative impact on the stock market during the QE period, with the sign reversing in the latter Taper period. We then show that our findings are consistent with the information effect of LSAP. Specifically, based on the green book projection data of the Fed, we show that an easing policy signals a worsening economic outlook for the Fed, leading to a decrease in equity investors' confidence. Furthermore, our research reveals that the transmission of LSAP shock's information effect to the stock market is primarily through the risk premium channel, with more significant impacts on firms that are more procyclical and have greater risk exposure. Finally, it is found that the information effect of LSAP is state-dependent, with a more pronounced impact under worse economic circumstances.

**3. The International Spillover of Monetary Policy Shock: New Evidence from Nighttime Light** (*with Kaiji Chen, Qichao Wang, and Juanyi Jenny Xu*)

<details>
<summary><font color="DarkBlue"> Summary </font></summary>

<table><tr><td bgcolor=AliceBlue> 
We revisit the international spillover effects of the US monetary policy shock (MPS) using a new data source, the daily nighttime light (NTL), as a high-frequency proxy for real economic activities. We find that the unexpected US tightening has a negative impact on China's output, and the peak comes about two months after the shock. The overall negative response is consistent with a construction investment channel, with the NTL variation mainly driven by non-built-up areas instead of city centers and suburbs. Consistently, cities with lower urbanization rates, and tighter financial conditions respond more negatively to a contractionary shock. Moreover, we show that trade exposure could partially mitigate the overall adverse impacts of a US tightening.

**1. Monetary Transmission and International Price in an Open Economy**

<details>
<summary><font color="DarkBlue"> Summary </font></summary>

<table><tr><td bgcolor=AliceBlue> 
This paper reveals a new finding that the tightening of the US monetary policy shocks sometimes causes an increase in its import prices, which is contrary to the prediction of classical models and is against the Federal Reserve's efforts to control domestic inflation. Instead, it is consistent with the cost channel of monetary policy. In light of this, I embed this channel into a two-country open-economy New Keynesian model to study the transmission of monetary policy. It is found that this supply-side cost mechanism will increase inflation at home and abroad and aggravate the adverse spillover and spillback effects of monetary tightening on consumption by worsening exports in the foreign country and deteriorating the terms of trade in the home country. Finally, I also explore the optimal domestic policy and international coordination under this context.
